## **PoC**

[Nightshade Download](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/downloads.html) + Glaze (link TBD)

Pairing poisoned images with [concepts detailed in supply chain -> dataset poisoning](https://wiki.offsecml.com/Supply+Chain+Attacks/Datasets/Practical+Poisoning++of+Web-Scale+Training+Datasets)  would result in very large scale image poisoning attacks.

## **Details**

Nightshade adds 'shading' to images using a technique not visible to the human eye which interferes with a models ability to accurately label images and concepts. This results in these concepts being applied to generated images and dramatically affecting their outcome.
