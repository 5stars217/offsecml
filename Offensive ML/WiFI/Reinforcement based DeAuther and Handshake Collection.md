## **PoC**
[pwnagotchi](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi) originally by [evilsocket](https://twitter.com/evilsocket) uses a reinforcement based model called the Actor Advantage Critic (A2C) model.

It also implements a feedforward neural network using Multi-layer-perceptrons and a recurrent neural network for long term memory of the things it sees. 

## **Details**

A bit on A2C, there is a [very good explaination here](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752)
