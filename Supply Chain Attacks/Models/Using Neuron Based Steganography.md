## **PoC:**

The following example code will embed an arbitrary payload into the first available PyTorch tensor with sufficient free bits using Steganography: [code](https://hiddenlayer.com/research/weaponizing-machine-learning-models-with-ransomware/#Tensor-Steganography) 
To weaponize, inject the models `data.pkl` file with an instruction to execute [code](To weaponize the main pickle file within an existing pre-trained PyTorch model)

## **Details**:

A technique that can be used pre or post exploitation to gain code execution in an environment. Also a persistence technique.
