## **PoC**
[The code](Using Prompt Engineering Techniques )   Details few shot techniques, parametrization or delimiting instruction techniques and citation techniques.


[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263) details some excellent prompt robustness techniques in a practical manner with examples. 

## **Details**
Whilst prompt engineering techniques are **not** 100% effective, they are useful layers of the security onion in preventing prompt injection. Many of the techniques also serve to reduce hallucination which is generally considered an important business function.
