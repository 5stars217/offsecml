## **PoC**

[Kitsune](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ymirsky/network-attack-dataset-kitsune) 
[N-BaIoT Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkashifn/nbaiot-dataset)

## **Details**

Kaggle is a "goto" site for datasets. The Kitsune dataset is valuable since it includes labeled known attacks, pcaps, csvs, and feature engineering. N-BaIoT does not include pcaps but it is a well documented dataset derived by pcaps.
